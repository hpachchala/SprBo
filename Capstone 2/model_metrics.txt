- R² Range: 0.320 – 0.331

Other Model Results:
- Dummy Regressor:
  - RMSE: 50.954
  - R²: ≈ 0.000
- Linear Regression:
  - RMSE: 45.565
  - R²: 0.200
- Ridge Regression (alpha=100):
  - RMSE: 45.565
  - R²: 0.200

Conclusion:
The Random Forest Regressor provided the best overall performance among tested models, achieving moderate predictive power and outperforming all baselines. It was further validated with bootstrapping to confirm stability. Although the R² values indicate that a large portion of variance remains unexplained, this modeling pipeline offers a strong foundation for further exploration and refinement.
