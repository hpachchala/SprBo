# SD_RIPA_StopDuration

This project investigates stop duration patterns using the San Diego Police Departmentâ€™s RIPA (Racial and Identity Profiling Act) dataset. My goal is to identify which factors influence the length of police stops and build a predictive model to estimate stopduration in minutes.

The San Diego RIPA dataset is available from the City of San Diego Open Data Portal:

In `ripa_data_wrangling.ipynb`, I merged the base stop dataset (`ripa_stops_historic.csv`) with 14 supplementary tables, including officer-perceived gender, race, search basis, and stop outcomes. These are joined on the `uid` field to create a fully enriched dataset ready for cleaning.

In `ripa_eda.ipynb`, I explored key trends in stopduration. I observed that most stops last under 20 minutes, but longer durations are associated with contraband found, arrests made, and certain demographic profiles. Officer-perceived race and gender appear to correlate with stop length, particularly for Hispanic/Latino and male individuals.

In `ripa_preprocessing.ipynb`, I transformed the data for modeling:
- Parsed timestamps into `stop_hour` and `time_of_day` bins
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Standardized numerical variables
- Imputed missing values
- Applied feature pruning using `SelectFromModel` with Random Forest

In `ripa_modeling.ipynb`, I trained and evaluate five models:
- Dummy Regressor  
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (sampled for efficiency)

Among these, the Random Forest model achieves the best results:
- **Test RMSE:** 41.57  
- **Test RÂ²:** 0.334  
- **Train RÂ²:** 0.489  
- **Bootstrapped RÂ² Range:** 0.320 â€“ 0.331 (20 runs)

Although overall predictive performance is moderate, the model is stable and interpretable. It highlights patterns that can help support fairness and transparency in traffic stop outcomes.
